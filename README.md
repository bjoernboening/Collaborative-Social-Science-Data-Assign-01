# Collaborative-Social-Science-Data-Assign-01
Course assignment 01

I will use the UKgas dataset from RStudio
The aim of this assignment is to get familiar with the tools R and github

Later we want to collaborate on a data analysis project in our course, hence this readme will try make all my relevant steps in the R code as plausible and transparent as possible.
