# Collaborative-Social-Science-Data-Assign-01
Course assignment 01

I will use the UKgas dataset from RStudio
The aim of this assignment is to get familiar with the tools R and github

Later we want to collaborate on a data analysis project in our course, hence this readme will try make all my relevant steps in the R code as plausible and transparent as possible.

Firstly I assume that the total gas consumption in the UK from 1960 to 1987 has risen (year by year).
Sencondly I expect that the usage in the first quarter of a year is always the highest within that year.

The second dataset Orange from R shows the age and the circumference of orange trees.
Here the descriptive statistics should convince that older trees have more circumference as well.
